Version 0.1.4 (August 10, 2014):
Added collision with enemies
Modified <player> to get only <vertex> as spawn point, and not a <movement>
Added "hit-size" to <player> to set the radius of player hitbox, to "inflate" all hit-bodies in the game
Fixed some bullets not colliding because multithreading

Version 0.1.3 (August 10, 2014):

Fixed angle corretion for hit-polygon rotation
Added basic multithread to draw and collide more efficiently

Version 0.1.2 (August 10, 2014):
Fixed "inside-checking" in hit-polygons
Fixed a critical bug about cyrus-beck algorith

Version 0.1.1 (August 10, 2014):
Fixed some internal errors

Version 0.1 (Agusut 9, 2014):
Added collision system for circles and convex polygons: <hit-circle> and <hit-polygon>
Added <hit-body> to contain multiple <hit-circle> or <hit-polygon> into an entity
Added parameter "spin" to <movement> to get local rotation angle, default: 90 (general correction) 
Added parameter "look-at-direction" to <movement> to specify if sprite rotates at where is moving, default: yes (for bullets), enemies use to have "no"
Added <animation> which contains a set of <sprites> with a duration, animations can loop, now the entities have <animation> instead of <sprite>
Added <player> with control with arrows and focus with left SHIFT

Version 0.06.1 (August 5, 2014):
Fixed <direction-modifier> not having motionStart and motionEnd
Added "exponent" attribute for each basic atribute of <direction> in the <direction-modifier>

Changed <wave> attribute "repeat" to be a number of repetitions, <0 for infinite, default: 0
Added inheritance disable option to the <direction>
Added <wave> attribute "exponent" that allows to curve the time used for bullet spawning, default: 1

Version 0.05.1 (July 28, 2014):
Fixed wave time calculation not working properly
Modified XML sample

Renamed XML attributes with multiple words for a better reading
Added <wave> absolute spawn position
Added <wave> attribute: waves (to repeat all the waves counting)
Added new <direction> attributes:
- motion: rotation acceleration
- random offsets for all the attributes (default 0)

Added XML import duplication protection
Fixed attributes with "start" and "end" values not using the "end" value in last iteration
Rotation is now measured in degrees/second

Version 0.04 (July 21, 2014):
Removed <horde> and <wave> takes its place, now <wave> can do its job
Now <wave> can use timestart and timeend on other <wave>
Combined XML samples, still a lot to test

Version 0.03.7 (July 20, 2014):
Added spawnpoint combination from <wave> to the insiders <wave>

Now <wave> can inherit any time

Version 0.03.5 (July 20, 2014):
Added new type of <wave> that contains more <wave>, still not fully working, it only inherits once

Version 0.03.4 (July 20, 2014):
Added tag <direction-modifier> to be used with <wave> to alter the desired <direction> from the <bullet>

Version 0.03.3 (July 19, 2014):

Angle is inherited in a <movement> from a <direction> to the next one
Added new XML sample

Version 0.03.2 (July 19, 2014):
Added angleStart and angleEnd to <direction> in order to add rotation to <movement>

Bug fix: first bullet of some hordes not spawning

Version 0.02 (July 16, 2014):
