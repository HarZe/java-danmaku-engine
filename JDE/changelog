Version 0.06 (August 5, 2014):
Changed <wave> attribute "repeat" to be a number of repetitions, <0 for infinite, default: 0
Added inheritance disable option to the <direction>
Added <wave> attribute "exponent" that allows to curve the time used for bullet spawning, default: 1

Version 0.05.1 (July 28, 2014):
Fixed wave time calculation not working properly
Modified XML sample

Version 0.05 (July 27, 2014):
Renamed XML attributes with multiple words for a better reading
Added <wave> absolute spawn position
Added <wave> attribute: waves (to repeat all the waves counting)
Added new <direction> attributes:
- motion: rotation acceleration
- random offsets for all the attributes (default 0)

Version 0.04.1 (July 25, 2014):
Added XML import duplication protection
Fixed attributes with "start" and "end" values not using the "end" value in last iteration
Rotation is now measured in degrees/second

Version 0.04 (July 21, 2014):
Removed <horde> and <wave> takes its place, now <wave> can do its job
Now <wave> can use timestart and timeend on other <wave>
Combined XML samples, still a lot to test

Version 0.03.7 (July 20, 2014):
Added spawnpoint combination from <wave> to the insiders <wave>
New XML sample with all new features

Version 0.03.6 (July 20, 2014):
Now <wave> can inherit any time

Version 0.03.5 (July 20, 2014):
Added new type of <wave> that contains more <wave>, still not fully working, it only inherits once

Version 0.03.4 (July 20, 2014):
Added tag <direction-modifier> to be used with <wave> to alter the desired <direction> from the <bullet>

Version 0.03.3 (July 19, 2014):
Fixed angle to match 0ยบ degrees with "right"
Angle is inherited in a <movement> from a <direction> to the next one
Added new XML sample

Version 0.03.2 (July 19, 2014):
Added angleStart and angleEnd to <direction> in order to add rotation to <movement>
Added homing to <direction> which must have a home <vertex>, if homing is enabled, angleStart and angleEnd are ignored; experimental, not working properly yet

Version 0.03.1 (July 18, 2014):
Changed the previous <horde> to <wave>, now a single <horde> contains multiple <wave>
Modified XML sample to show the new feature

Version 0.03 (July 17, 2014):
Changed coordinates to be centered on the game zone
Added <direction> tag, now <movement> is composed of a set of <direction>
<spawn> tag now uses a <vertex> instead of x and y attributes

Version 0.02.1 (July 16, 2014):
Bug fix: first bullet of some hordes not spawning

Version 0.02 (July 16, 2014):
Spritesheet system based on XML
XML import system (an XML can read other XML info) to avoid large XML files
Entities rotation to look where they are going is configurable (enemies do not look where they are going, but bullets do)
Delete out of zone bullets & enemies (adding hitbox) to improve performance
Added XML samples and spritesheets

Version 0.01.1 (July 15, 2014):
Bug fix: enemies moving when bullets spawn
Added XML file selection using the first argument when executing

Version 0.01 (July 15, 2014):
Added basic mechanics for XML parsing, enemy and bullets (hordes) spawning and moving.
